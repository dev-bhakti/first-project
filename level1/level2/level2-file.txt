Maharashtra was formed by merging the western and south-western parts of the Bombay State, Berar and Vidarbha, and the north-western parts of the Hyderabad State and splitting Saurashtra (in present-day Gujarat) by the States Reorganisation Act. It has over 112 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population around 18 million making it the most populous urban area in India. Nagpur hosts the winter session of the state legislature.[10] Pune is known as the 'Oxford of the East' due to the presence of several well-known educational institutions.[11][12] Nashik is known as the 'Wine Capital of India' as it has the largest number of wineries and vineyards in the country.
